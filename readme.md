## What is Andpay - Algo Payments?
Andpay is the first pure payment service provider that makes payments fast and simple, fully leveraging the Algorand blockchain. We've chosen the Algorand blockchain as our payment infrastructure, as it has unique qualities such as:

- Low blockchain transaction fee (only 0.001 Algo)
- 1000 transactions per second (soon up to 46k per second)
- Block finalisation in less than 4.5 seconds (soon to be 2.5 seconds)

Andpay fully focuses on building the payment service provider for the Algorand blockchain. Therefore integrating many day-to-day apps with the blockchain through Andpay.
